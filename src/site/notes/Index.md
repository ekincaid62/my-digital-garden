### Introduction


In the heart of West Virginia, where the **New River**, **Monongahela River**, and **Meadow River** carve their paths northward, family ties run just as deep. I grew up in **Mt. Lookout, WV**, less than two miles from **Meadow River** and just a short drive from the **New River**. In a place where everyone seemed connected, I never questioned how or why—we just were.

My older brother passed away in 2010, leaving behind a wealth of information he had collected about our family and the community. My goal was to preserve it in digital format and make it accessible to anyone interested. While I succeeded in digitizing everything, I never quite found an easy way to share it—until now. This website is my attempt to bring that history to life and make it available to all who seek to explore their roots.

Let’s see where these roots lead!
