### Introduction


There are 3 rivers that flow north in West Virginia. Almost everyone knows of the **New River**. The other two are **Monongahela** and **Meadow**. In close proximity to the **New River** is **Meadow River** which originates in Summers County and runs Northwest and merges into the Gauley River. I grew up in Mt. Lookout WV, less than 2 miles from Meadow River and only a short drive to the New River. Growing up there it seemed that everyone was related and that wasn't far from the truth. I never really questioned it or how it was that we were related. Let's start exploring the relations and see where these roots go.
