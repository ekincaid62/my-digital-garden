### Introduction


In the heart of West Virginia, where the **New River**, **Monongahela River**, and **Meadow River** carve their paths northward, family ties run just as deep. I grew up in **Mt. Lookout, WV**, less than two miles from **Meadow River** and just a short drive from the **New River**. In a place where everyone seemed connected, I never questioned how or why—we just were.

Now, it's time to explore those connections. Genealogy isn't just about names and dates; it's about uncovering the stories that bind us together. Whether your family has been here for generations or you're just beginning your search, let’s trace our roots, piece together the past, and discover the history woven through the hills of West Virginia.

Let’s see where these roots lead!
