The following children were buried at the Kincaid Cemetery in Kansas. Three of these children (died of consumption) were the family of Alfred and Eliza. Here is a [map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=1jR6WG2jYRuOLpG_JvQCuutccTRY&usp=sharing) of the original location of the cemetery. I was told that at some point the remains were removed and relocated according to this [[Evernote/Archive/FW Kincade Cemetery\|email]]
