I have tried almost everything you can imagine for storing my data.  Nothing fit the bill, and disappointed in one way or another.

I used Evernote for years and that worked reasonably well. However, I wanted to be able to share my data easily with anyone I wish and now use a program called Obsidian. What really sets Obsidian apart is the Community plug-ins that are freely available. I am in awe of what some of these intelligent people have put together.

So how does this Obsidian have anything to do with this website? Everything you see and read here comes from notes and data I have collected or written. With a plug-in named "Digital Garden" I can simply press a couple of buttons on a note and it gets uploaded to the website.
