I have tried almost everything you can imagine for storing my data.  Nothing fit the bill, and I was disappointed in one way or another.

I used Evernote for years and that worked reasonably well. However, I wanted to be able to share my data easily with anyone I wish easily and now use a program called [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/). What really sets Obsidian apart is the Community plug-ins that are freely available. I am in awe of what some of these intelligent people have put together.

So how does Obsidian have anything to do with this website? Everything you see and read here comes from notes and data I have collected or written. With a plug-in named "[Obsidian Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden)" by *Ole Eskild Steensen*, I can simply press a couple of buttons on a note and it gets uploaded to the website. There is a little work getting it setup. For more information on how to set it up take a look at the [Setup Guide](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/getting-started/01-getting-started/)
